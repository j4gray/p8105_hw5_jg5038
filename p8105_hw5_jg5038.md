## Problem 1: Birthday problem

``` r
#define data generating mechanism
birthdays = sample(1:365, 5, replace = TRUE)

#run the analysis
repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < 5

#return the result
repeated_bday
```

    ## [1] FALSE

put this in a function

``` r
bday_sim = function(n_room) {
  
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)

  repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room

  repeated_bday
}

#bday_sim(20)
```

``` r
bday_sim_results = 
  expand_grid(
    bdays = 5:50,
    iter = 1:1000
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    result = map_lgl(bdays, bday_sim)
  ) |> 
  group_by (
    bdays
  ) |> 
  summarize(
    prob_repeat = mean(result)
  )
```

plot this

``` r
bday_sim_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = bdays, y = prob_repeat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

Problem 2 = if you’re study is underpowered, you’re going to
overestimate effect size. If only see significant results = not getting
idea of what real value is
